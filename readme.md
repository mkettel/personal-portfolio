# Personal Portfolio

## Summary
I built this portfolio to demonstrate how much I enjoy the creative and intellectual aspects of programming to showcase some of my most recent projects that I have built. It is an ongoing project and I hope that you enjoy the outcome :)

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
