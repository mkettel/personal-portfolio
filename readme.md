# Personal Portfolio

## Summary
I built this portfolio to demonstrate how much I enjoy the creative and intellectual aspects of programming. It is also a way to showcase some of my most recent projects that I have built. It is an ongoing project and I hope that you enjoy the outcome :)

Please check out the project [here!](https://matthewkettelkamp.com/)
